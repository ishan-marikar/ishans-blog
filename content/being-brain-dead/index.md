.. or How To Not Exhaust Your Creative Juices.

**_Work In Progress — If this line is still here, it’s not done yet._**

It’s 1pm in the afternoon and I’m sitting in the reclining chairs of the Cabbage (actually Surge’s) office main hall, discussing with Ruban and Dulitha about the the technicalities of a specific problem, throwing around ideas and brainstorming. Dulitha and Ruban are firing away at each other with all kinds of questions, and there’s me, sitting still, watching these two and trying so hard to be productive and at the very least, contribute to the conversation. 

Fuck. This isn’t working. My brain isn’t processing at all. My mind’s drawing a blank. Nyet. Nothing. Nada. Zilt.

I’d like to call myself a creative, but in instances like this, you feel so demotivated. Like, what is wrong with me? Have I finally burnt out? I probably have. Should I stock up on more Caffeine? Probably not going to help.
