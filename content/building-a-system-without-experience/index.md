(Dilhan’s Article)

This is based on my personal experience.

I didn’t have a lot of experience in the software industry to start with, but I wanted to build something and start developing my ideas. I was lucky enough to find a place to work, and that too with some of my colleagues, but due to the company down-sizing, I was laid off and couldn’t really finish to gain more than a few months of experience. It was fun while it lasted but I was not off to a good start. 

I had my University’s final project nearing and it required us to build something that had some sort of AI element, so I went ahead and decided to do a ‘Paddy Disease Recognition System’. 

Now that the idea was set, I needed to go ahead and build this. There was just one problem though. I didn’t know enough to do this. What I had learned in university wasn’t enough to finish this, and I had a mere three months to finish this, and furthermore, we have a ‘viva’ session where the lectures take a look at the progress of the system and comment on any specifics/issues. The first session is one where we introduce our system and where I needed their approval. I could probably make this work and fluff my way through this session, but I doubted my capability of actually being able to complete this project. 

Even thinking about the sessions made my palms clammy.

“Focus. Focus. FOCUS.” I told myself. I needed to start somewhere. The UI was probably the easiest to start with, and required the least effort so I drew the UI on paper and tried to figure out a high level flow of the process to make it easier for me to visualise how to go forward with it and how I needed to tackle it. I met a friend at the University of Moratuwa so I could have a second pair of eyes and good instincts to go over it and see what I did wrong and suggestions for ideas. I also borrowed his lecture notes so I could get a better understanding of AI.

Now for choosing the technologies. At University, we used Netbeans with Java, but seeing as there wasn’t much of a community for AI with Java, I decided to look around and came across Matlab, which was a beautifully powered beast, and it was more catered towards the AI crowd and had a lot of functionality and features to support it.

I still hadn’t put much thought into the AI part of it, and most of it was pretty vague in my head. Now with AI, we need to understand the strips of detail we have to feed it, and this process is called ‘feature extraction’, and then figure out what feature extraction method would be suitable for this use-case. I went through a few and came across one that seemed best for what I set out to do.

Stress was building up, and I needed to manage it. I didn’t know how to start the code and even when I did, I had issues with my IDE . I called my friend from the university, and he showed me how to set up the databases and the basics of the neural network, and realising this gave me relief. I youtube-ed a couple of tutorials on neural networks, got assistance from a friend of mine.
