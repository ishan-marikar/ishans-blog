Day One — After the “Break up”

I wake up with a sinking feeling in my chest. Not even sure how I’m going to make it through the day from what happened last night. I screwed up. I definitely screwed up. I lost the one person keeping my head above the water, so I don’t drown. I said some pretty mean things I didn’t mean. I hurt her in ways I never intended to. Looking back, she didn’t deserve any of the shit I gave her. She was going through some shit on her own and I wasn’t helping her. I was dragging her down with me.

I tried to call her, but the calls were un-responsive. I kept trying until my fingers hurt. To get through, to try to fix what’s left. None went through. Felt like that was the nail in the coffin. She didn’t to talk to me. She was mad at me. She despised me. She probably hated me. At least I felt like she did. 

I’ve been wearing my heart upon my sleeve. 

I need to fix this. I prioritise this more than anything else in my life.
