> _It’s 12 fucking AM and I’m supposed to be sleeping, but I’m not. It’s not because I don’t want to, it’s because I can’t and these voices in my heads keep arguing over so many issues to a point where I don’t really know what to do anymore. Meanwhile, the house is almost silent (besides for the tunes squeaking out of my headphones). My mom is in her room, my brothers in theirs and my dad nowhere in sight. Our food supply is low and we’re trying to make due with the funds we have and sources being mom’s variating income based on the season and the clients she has and me making a solid paycheck, although none of it will be able to cover._

> _I’ve let myself get attached to people when I know I shouldn’t and it I’m pretty sure this is going to end badly. I’ve gotten a crush on a girl that I know who seems too unreal to be true. It’s weird coming across somebody who’s characteristics and mannerisms are so eerily similar to mine, and this just to name a few._

  

It’s 12 fucking AM, and I’m supposed to be sleeping, but I’m obviously not. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I can’t. The voice is my head keep arguing and my mind is a mess. It’s dark, the lights are off and everybody in my house is fast asleep. All I can do is lay down and stare up at the ceiling and try to come to terms with what’s happening to me. My parents are almost always in conflict.
