They say that if you love somebody, you let them go. I did that, while not showing how much I was breaking inside, was the hardest thing I had ever done. I said goodbye to the one person in my life that had made me truly happy. Why? Because I couldn’t stand to hurt her anymore because of my emotional instabilities and my fuck-ups. I didn’t want it all come to an end with her hating me.

I honestly am glad that I had someone like her play a big part in my life. She was the most unique person you could ever meet.
