**WORK IN PROGRESS.  
If this line exists, this piece of work isn’t finished yet.**

It’s inevitable that you catch feelings, and when you do realize that you’ve actually gotten attached to somebody, the little voice in your head screams out “Well, this is going to hurt like a motherfucker”. You start panicking and start figuring how could this have happened? How could you have been foolish to let your guards down? What’s worse is that it’s to somebody you can’t have.

  
You spend days and nights talking to that person, anticipating their every message. You don’t really know what ‘this’ actually is. Is this a friendship? Tell me so I can treat you like a friend. Are you talking to other people? Let me know so I can talk to other people too. Are you only talking to me? I need to know so I can commit too. Are you not feeling it? Stop fucking wasting my time then.  
Don’t give me mixed signals and lead me on, and eventually break my heart. I’m not about to have feelings for someone who’ll leave me hanging and I don’t want to lead someone on if I don’t know what they might want.

  
The next time I open up to somebody would be my autopsy.
