.. or convincing yourself that you are 

“I don’t belong here. These people are obviously so much smarter and more competent than me. I couldn’t possible accomplish the same feats they have. I’m just an imposter. I’m a fraud. I’m not skilled enough, experienced enough or qualified enough to justify me being here.”

These words keep ringing in my head, over and over again.
