From me to the blogosphere.

I’ve been meaning to start blogging again, but I constantly keep getting side-tracked, with work, education and all, it seems hard to find the time to do something you enjoy, but nonetheless, I’m going to take up the challenge to post an article (of some sort) as frequently as possible.

Please do note that I am not a writer of any sort and the last time I’ve actually written anything worth reading was quite a while ago, so please do bare with me and I will try my utmost to get better.

All this and I forgot to introduce myself. Typical me.

Hi, I’m Ishan Marikar. I am a young, mostly self-taught and very curious software developer and maker of things. I love exploring, experimenting, screwing around, building, breaking, learning and working with the bleeding edge of technologies, and I’ve been doing all this ever since the age of two.

I’m also considered an ‘_empath’_ and I have controversial views and ideas and a unorthodox way of doing things.

I currently work at IDAMA Innovations as a Tech Development Engineer, and we’re working on an exciting new platform that we hope would radically change the landscape of how services are provided here in Sri Lanka (not giving you any hints just yet).

.. and that’s it. Here’s to hoping that I actually keep my promise of posting.

Until we meet again. _Salut mon ami(e)._
